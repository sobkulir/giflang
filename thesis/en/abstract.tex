The goal of this thesis is to create a programming language with characters and keywords substituted
with images and animations (GIFs). We build a web IDE and a client-side interpreter for this language
using modern web technologies including WebWorkers, TypeScript and React.

The IDE features a code-stepping with information about current location in the source
code, environment variables and a call stack. Additionally, there is a support for storing programs on the server
and loading them later.

Primarily, it will be used at programming camps for elementary and high schoolers. The author of this thesis designs
creative games for these camps, usually related to Computer Science. The language created in this thesis will
be incorporated into the games.

At the time of writing, we could not find any other such programming language.
