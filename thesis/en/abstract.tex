The goal of this thesis is to create a programming language with characters and keywords substituted
with images or animations (GIFs). We build a web IDE and a client-side interpreter for this language
using modern web technologies including WebWorkers, TypeScript and React.

The IDE features a code stepper with information about current location in the source
code, environment variables and call stack. Additionally, there is a support for storing and loading
source code from the cloud using Firebase. 

Primarily, it will be used at programming camps for elementary and high schoolers. We create creative
games for the camps usually related to Computer Science. The language from this thesis will be incorporated
into the games.

At the time of writing, we could not find any other such programming language.
